                        Yup. It's 2021 now. I started development on this site on 3rd December 2019, making this
                        site just over one year old! And it's definitely come a long way since I first started
                        making it. I think I'm right in assuming that pretty much everyone reading this post
                        has no idea what the original site looked like. And that's a good thing - it was absolutely
                        disgusting. So, both to round up the year (I know I'm a <i>bit</i> late but oh well) and 
                        to mark one year of this site being up, I thought I'd take a look at the old versions of
                        this site. <small>oh this was such a bad idea</small>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Version 1</h3><p><small>designers, look away now, or risk throwing up when you see it</small></p>
                    <div class="row" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left: 0;">
                        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xs-12 p-0">
                            <p class="mr-1">
                                Right then, let's get started. This is <i>by far</i> the most painful version of this
                                site. I'm kind of embarrassed to show it, to be honest. But hey, it wasn't the worst
                                thing in the world. The colour scheme used in this version is pretty much the same as
                                the colour scheme I use now, except that for some reason I chose to use the inverted
                                version of my logo in the navbar. I still have no idea why I did that. Anyway, time
                                for the bit you've been waiting for. Here's a screenshot of the homepage:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-8 col-xs-12 p-0">
                            <img src="img/v1-home.png" alt="paiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        It's just pure <i>pain</i>. It looks worse than my program hub - and that's an achievement.
                        You can't see where one post ends and the next begins, for some reason my logo is next
                        to <i>every single post</i>, and the posts <i>aren't even centred</i>. Whilst it could
                        quite easily be worse, it just looks disgusting. It wasn't at all responsive - the text 
                        just became illegible when the page was viewed on mobile. Pretty much all of the pages on that
                        version of the site looked like this. Oh, except for the SOSC page. That one wasn't
                        <i>too</i> bad, but has since been removed from this site. One more bad thing about the
                        development side of that site - none of the content was generated, meaning I had to go
                        into the HTML file and manually add grid rows every time I wanted to make a new post.
                        That was <i>not</i> a fun process. This version (or at least the one in use at the time
                        of writing) of the site is pretty much built off of JSON files - if you poke around in
                        the inspector for long enough you'll probably find the JSON file (or files) that make 
                        up each of the pages. In fact, I think the only pages on my site that aren't generated
                        from JSON files are these longer post pages...
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Version 2</h3><p><small>hey, it doesn't burn my eyes out when i look at it anymore</small></p>
                    <div class="row" style="max-width: 100%; margin-left: 0;">
                        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xs-12 p-0">
                            <p class="mr-1">
                                Right then, version 2. This was the first version to use Bootstrap (although it was Bootstrap
                                3). This meant that you could actually read the contents when on mobile! Yay! The colour
                                scheme used for this version is exactly the same as the colour scheme I currently use. The
                                thing about this version that annoys me most is the fact that none of the posts appear the 
                                same height. This means you get a weird mess of differently sized boxes when you try to look
                                at all of the posts. Here's a screenshot of the homepage:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-8 col-xs-12 p-0">
                            <img src="img/v2-home.png" alt="less pain">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This was also the first version to generate its content off of JSON files. That means
                        I technically had the ability to use multiple languages on the site, but just forgot
                        to implement it. The script I use now allows me to properly add versions of this site
                        in other languages. However, due to the fact that the only languages I can speak at a 
                        decent level are English, French and Japanese (and I still suck at French and Japanese),
                        I haven't translated many pages.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        And that brings us up to today! This site still has quite a few issues I need to deal
                        with, but it's good enough for now. Oh, and this post totally wasn't just an excuse
                        to test out the new longer post system I just finished making ðŸ˜….
