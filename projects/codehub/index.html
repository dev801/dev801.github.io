                    This is the base of all of my other projects. If you want to download anything, you can get it through here.

                    <h3>Installation:</h3>
                    Pretty simple. Donwload the installer <a  href="https://dev801.github.io/projects/codehub/dev801%20Project%20Hub%20Installer%20(32%20Bit).exe">here</a> (it's an exe. Sorry Mac users, but what are you doing using
                    a Mac anyway?), run it, accept all the fancy license stuff, and probably tick the box to add a desktop 
                    shortcut. Once you've done that, you should be good to go! Also, it needs internet access otherwise it dies
                    as soon as you run it. There's a log file somewhere in its data folder if you fancy trying to figure out what
                    it's doing. Yeah. That's pretty much it.

                    <h3>Usage/Bugs:</h3>
                    <b>ALWAYS RUN THIS AS AN ADMINISTRATOR!!!</b> Certain things may die if you don't. It'll make it quite clear
                    if it hasn't been run as an administrator. The only bug I've found so far is that it continues to try to 
                    download projects even when the program has been stopped.

                    <h3>Random Notes:</h3>
                    Sorry for the awful graphics in this project. I pretty much just wanted to get it done as soon as possible
                    so that I could work on other things. Inside the program, you'll be able to see the current verion of the 
                    program you're trying to download, as well as a short description of it. It's a pretty awful program, but 
                    it'll do for now.
