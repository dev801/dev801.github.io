I only had like half a week to work on this so it isn't quite as polished as I'd like it to be, but it's good enough for now. The only dependency is pygame - other than that, if you're running Python 3.6+ you <i>shouldn't</i> have any issues. Only has Pokémon from Bulbasaur to Ekans. Oh, and Pikachu.",
