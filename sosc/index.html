                        <p>We begin with attempting to all connect to the same Skype call. Should be easy, right? <b style="font-size: 20px;">NO.</b><br />
                        Prior to the actual call starting, it had been scheduled around 3 or 4 times before we all managed to join the
                        Skype group and accept the call. And even after it was finally scheduled, some people had trouble with Skype
                        once it had started up - the Healy Cleric Guy's microphone completely broke, and he had to spend god knows
                        how long getting that fixed.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, we had all joined the same call and could at least sort of hear each other, so we decided to make
                        a start on creating characters for Janitor Z and James - James ended up with a High Elf wizard named Alyndra
                        Sarrbarand. Janitor Z also ended up with a High Elf wizard, this one named Sylvalur Ethanasath (which sounds
                        like something sraight out of hell in my opinion). Both belong to the School of Evocation. I'm not sure exactly
                        what Healy Cleric Guy's character was because of some issues we had with getting neccessary character sheets,
                        but I'm pretty sure that he was also an Elf.</p>
                        <p>The highest level character in the game was Bob Ross Jr. at level 4. Everyone else started at level 2.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px">Anyway, with that out of the way, we moved on to the story...</p>
                        <p>We were walking into town (the name of which escapes me at the time of writing) and were immediately arressted.
                        The Almighty Neil said he wasn't sure why we were arressted, which left us with pretty much zero chance of getting
                        out. I mean, it's pretty hard to plead innocent when neither you nor the almighty voice in the sky know why you're
                        being convicted! Anyway, we were told that the prison had been paid to let us free by some random old guy. I think
                        he's important to the story, but he did have a certain "I'm better than you" air around him. We were told by another
                        random old dude that the first random old dude would like to see us, so we complied, and followed directions to
                        a semi-ghostly looking castle on top of a hill. No one thought of just knocking on the door, so James barreled foot
                        first into it and smashed it in. As James stepped back, mildly concussed, we were "greeted" by someone who looked
                        like a servant, telling us to climb to the top of the tower to reach his master.</p>
                        <p>Once at the top, we were met with another set of double doors; James began to charge towards them but Healy
                        Cleric Guy got there first and opened them. This meant that James essentially karate kicked thin air and almost
                        fell flat on his face. The old dude in that room wasn't very impressed with James' performance, and quickly
                        turned his attention to giving us a mission. He lobbed a playing card at Healy Cleric Guy and said that something
                        called "Ruin" had escaped from it, and that we needed to get it back for him else be put back in prison. Multiple
                        questions sprung from this command: What is "Ruin"? Is it just the abstract concept of being ruined? I thought
                        that was a place in France? Pretty much none of these were answered, and from there we were told to go to a pub
                        where we would be able to find people to help us.</p>
