                            We begin with attempting to all connect to the same Skype call. Should be easy, right? <b style="font-size: 20px;">NO.</b><br />
                            Prior to the actual call starting, it had been scheduled around 3 or 4 times before we all managed to join the
                            Skype group and accept the call. And even after it was finally scheduled, some people had trouble with Skype
                            once it had started up - the Healy Cleric Guy's microphone completely broke, and he had to spend god knows
                            how long getting that fixed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eventually, we had all joined the same call and could at least sort of hear each other, so we decided to make
                            a start on creating characters for Janitor Z and James - James ended up with a High Elf wizard named Alyndra
                            Sarrbarand. Janitor Z also ended up with a High Elf wizard, this one named Sylvalur Ethanasath (which sounds
                            like something sraight out of hell in my opinion). Both belong to the School of Evocation. I'm not sure exactly
                            what Healy Cleric Guy's character was because of some issues we had with getting neccessary character sheets,
                            but I'm pretty sure that he was also an Elf.
                        </p>
                        <p>The highest level character in the game was Bob Ross Jr. at level 4. Everyone else started at level 2.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px">Anyway, with that out of the way, we moved on to the story...</p>
                        <p>
                            We were walking into town (the name of which escapes me at the time of writing) and were immediately arressted.
                            The Almighty Neil said he wasn't sure why we were arressted, which left us with pretty much zero chance of getting
                            out. I mean, it's pretty hard to plead innocent when neither you nor the almighty voice in the sky know why you're
                            being convicted! Anyway, we were told that the prison had been paid to let us free by some random old guy. I think
                            he's important to the story, but he did have a certain "I'm better than you" air around him. We were told by another
                            random old dude that the first random old dude would like to see us, so we complied, and followed directions to
                            a semi-ghostly looking castle on top of a hill. No one thought of just knocking on the door, so James barreled foot
                            first into it and smashed it in. As James stepped back, mildly concussed, we were "greeted" by someone who looked
                            like a servant, telling us to climb to the top of the tower to reach his master.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once at the top, we were met with another set of double doors; James began to charge towards them but Healy
                            Cleric Guy got there first and opened them. This meant that James essentially karate kicked thin air and almost
                            fell flat on his face. The old dude in that room wasn't very impressed with James' performance, and quickly
                            turned his attention to giving us a mission. He lobbed a playing card at Healy Cleric Guy and said that something
                            called "Ruin" had escaped from it, and that we needed to get it back for him else be put back in prison. Multiple
                            questions sprung from this command: What is "Ruin"? Is it just the abstract concept of being ruined? I thought
                            that was a place in France? Pretty much none of these were answered, and from there we were told to go to a pub
                            where we would be able to find people to help us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On arriving outside the pub, several halflings were thrown out of windows. Wondering if this was just the DM
                            trying to fit more words into his descriptions, we wandered inside and were met with the person throwing halflings
                            out of the windows. We were then told that this was one of our new teammates. Eek.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            James then thought, "I'm a drunkard, I'm gonna buy a drink" and so he went up to the bar and asked what was being
                            sole. The bartender responded: "We generally have high class clientele, so you can buy a beer for the low price of
                            20 gold pieces." Bob Ross then yelled across the bar at Alyndra, "That's an awful deal! Don't do it!" and was met
                            with glares from pretty much everyone in the bar. He then decided (I can't remember why) that he should chop the
                            bartender into three pieces and leggit. This went about as well as expected. Bob Ross rolled a 20 on his attack roll
                            and did cut the bartender into three pieces, but there happened to be royal guards standing next to the door (whom
                            Bob Ross didn't notice, damn you passive perception) who didn't particularly like this action. James and Janitor Z
                            cleaned up Bob Ross' mess by pretty much vapourising every living being in the bar (as well as about half of James'
                            face), and then they all ran away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They had now started on their journey towards Ruin, the possible French province. As they were making their way
                            through a forest, a thick mist came about. All party members but Bob Ross had Darkvision, so they were fine, but
                            Bob Ross was making a right fool of himself by tripping over assorted roots and rocks. Healy Cleric Guy decided
                            to help out (perhaps with some "encouragement") by carrying Bob Ross. This worked fine for a while, but then they
                            were attacked by some angry hairy troll things, and Bob Ross got dropped on the ground and took damage. They then
                            had a fight in which the majority got executed and Janitor Z managed to impale himself in the face with an Ice
                            Knife.
